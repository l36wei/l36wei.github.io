I'm an Assistant Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, in the School of Data Science. Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at HEC Montréal and the Université de Montréal. I earned my Ph.D. in Operations Research from Northwestern University，where I had the privilege of being supervised by [Simge Küçükyavuz](https://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~simge/index.html). I completed my bachelor's in combinatorics and optimization at the University of Waterloo. My research interests are in (Mixed) Integer programming, Machine Learning, and Logistics.
